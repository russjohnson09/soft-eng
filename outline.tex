Guidelines:
The term paper is on a topic related to the reading and lecture materials. See the ``Term Paper
Topics'' section for a recommended list of topics. The deadlines are shown in the ``Tentative
Schedule'' section. The body of your paper must be seven to ten pages of double-spaced material.
Pay attention to factors such as
\begin{itemize}
\item mechanics (grammar, punctuation, format, and spelling)
\item content and organization
\item analysis of the topic by you
\item paragraph structure and transition
\end{itemize}
